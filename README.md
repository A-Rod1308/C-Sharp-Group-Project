# C-Sharp-Group-Project
This project requires users to login in order to view a course catalog.
## Controllers
This project consists of two controllers: Courses and Catalog. The Courses controller is used to handle logins, sign ups, and allows vistors to visit the Home page. These views are: Login, Signup, and Index. The Catalog controller is used to handle the course catalog. The views in this controller are: Index, Details, Create, Edit, and Delete.
## Views
The Login view is used to display a form that is used to allow users to login. If the user entered the correct information, then they will be taken to the Home page after the form  has been submitted. When running this project, the first view that the user will see would be the Login view. The Signup view is used to display a form that is used to allow users  to sign up for the course catalog (a.k.a create an account). If the user entered the correct information, then they will be taken to the Login view after the form has been  submitted.
